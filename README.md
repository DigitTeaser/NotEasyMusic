1. The bottom bar in the App exists in every Activity except Playing Activity, it leads to duplicated codes in Java files. After searching on Google, I learnt that `Fragments` can deal with this situation by combining serveral layouts into one Activity. The course later will cover `Fragments`, so I leave this problem behind for now.
2. Some improvements can be done, such as ListView/RecycleView applied in Local Activity, using Android Pay API as Payment Activity, however due to time limitation, I have to put all this aside and maybe do it later.

This project is an Android App Structure for a music player app, unfortunately, it didn't implement any feature about a music player.  
The perpose of this project is to practise `OnClickListeners` and `Explicit Intent` in Android.

Note: The name of this app is inspired by [NetEase Music](https://music.163.com/).
